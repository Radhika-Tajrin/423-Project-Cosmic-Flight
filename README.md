# Cosmic Flight – An Interactive Space Navigation Game

Cosmic Flight is a 2D/3D space-navigation game inspired by tap-based arcade mechanics. The player controls a spacecraft traveling through outer space while avoiding dynamically generated obstacles such as asteroids, planets, and space debris. The game focuses on reflex-based movement, precision shooting, and increasing difficulty as the player progresses deeper into space.

## Objectives

- Design an engaging arcade-style space game with increasing difficulty  
- Combine navigation and shooting mechanics for enhanced gameplay  
- Provide an immersive visual experience using dynamic backgrounds  
- Implement multiple camera perspectives for varied player experience  

## Features

### Core Gameplay  
Navigate your spacecraft through space using key-based controls for vertical and depth movement while maintaining continuous forward motion. The game features real-time collision detection and a dynamic scoring system that rewards survival time and obstacles cleared.

### Obstacles & Combat  
Face procedurally spawned asteroids and space debris that increase in density and durability as you progress. Strategic shooting is key—launch projectiles with limited ammo to destroy certain obstacles while evading others that are dangerous to hit.

### Camera System  
Experience the game from multiple perspectives with switchable camera modes. Choose between a third-person view to see your spacecraft from behind or a first-person cockpit view for an immersive flight experience, with the ability to toggle between them during gameplay.

### Progressive Difficulty  
The challenge intensifies over time as obstacles become faster and stronger, demanding quicker reflexes and more precise shooting accuracy to survive deeper into space.
